# evictionmodel_190final

Final project for "Statistical Learning for Energy and Environment" (EnRes 190C) taught by Pr. Duncan Callaway. I attempt to predict future eviction rates within the city of SF using existing eviction data from SF Open Gov.

Course covered a suite of machine learning methods for prediction including (multiple) linear regression, KNN, random forest, regression trees, SVMs, Nueral Networks, gradient descent, regularization and related ensemble methods as well as data visualization techniques. Situated within the department of Energy and Resources, the course focused on issues of environmental racism and applications to renewable energy sources.
